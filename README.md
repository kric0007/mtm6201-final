## Process, Challenges & Solutions  

My development process began with translating a highly custom design into a responsive layout using Bootstrap. Initially, I planned to rely primarily on Bootstrap’s grid system and components to speed up development and maintain consistency across screen sizes.

One of the main challenges I faced was that my design was **very custom**, making it difficult to implement using Bootstrap alone. The framework’s predefined components and breakpoints did not always support the design variations I had planned across different screen sizes. As a result, I encountered limitations when trying to maintain consistency between layouts without significantly altering the visual design.

To overcome this, I incorporated **custom CSS and media queries**, rewriting and overriding many Bootstrap styles where necessary. This allowed me to better control layout behavior and responsiveness while preserving the design’s individuality.

## What I Learned  

Through this project, I gained valuable insight into balancing design freedom with framework constraints. I learned that when working with a framework like Bootstrap, it is important either to:
- design with those limitations in mind from the start, or  
- be prepared to extend the framework significantly with custom CSS.

I also learned the importance of minimizing drastic layout changes between breakpoints to reduce complexity and unnecessary code repetition. Overall, this project helped strengthen my understanding of responsive design, media queries, and how to adapt frameworks to better suit custom design requirements.
